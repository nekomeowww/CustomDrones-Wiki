## Spawn, Drops & Behavior
* These babies can easily spawn in any biome in group of 1 to 8 drones.  
* When killed they drop drone bit, sometimes rare drone bit (aqua item name, used to make Homing plasma gun), and the parts they are made of.  
* Baby drones always fly in a herd, which means quite close together. And if you attack one baby drone in a herd, all nearby baby drones will attack you.
* Their engine rank(wing color) determines their flying speed, core rank(head color) determines attack power, casing rank - not detectable, determines health.
* Hit pretty hard, 1-5 hearts per hit
* For each part, the chances for the ranks are 53% rank I, 27% rank II, 13% rank III, 7% rank IV

## Color pattern
You can easily see that they look quite different from each other.

First, their body and lower body color is based on the biome they are spawned in.
Second, their head and wing color depends on their core and engine rank respectively. Rank I being gray, rank II being yellow, rank III being diamond-aqua, and rank IV being emerald-green.
