### Wild part drones are basically your lifesaver (in case you life revolves around making drones)

## Spawn, Drops & Behavior
* Spawn in any biome in group of 1. Pretty higher spawn chance than big baby drones
* When killed will drop the held item
* Will never run away (or say fly away) from you
* Similar parts to baby drones
* Can hold drone parts, iron ingot, gold ingot, diamond, emerald, or TNT. Wild parts holding a TNT will fly towards you then explode(like a suicide bomber)
* Explosion size depends on core rank (indicated by head bar color)
