Plasma gun and Homing plasma gun are the first 2 guns you can craft from drone parts and drone bits.

## Plasma gun
To craft normal plasma gun, you need 1 core mkI, 1 casing mkI, 1 chip mkI, and a drone bit

Right click to shoot. Plasma gun deals 1.5 heart damage, the plasma bullet is not affected by gravity and will fly forever until collided with something.

## Homing plasma gun
If luckily, you got a rare drone bit (signified by a drone bit with aqua-colored name), you can craft a homing plasma gun

This guns deals 2.5 hearts damage. And the projectile when shot will lock to the entity that is targeted like this.
The maximum locking range is 64 blocks. If there is no locked entity, then the shot will be like a normal plasma shot, just with higher damage.

## Plasma gun's battery
Like drones, these guns have battery (indicated like tools damage).  
Each shot consumes 10 battery, and for homing plasma gun, the shot consumes more battery based on how far the locked entity is.  
When the battery is almost depleted, make sure you have battery recovering items in your inventory. When battery is out, the gun will consume the first item it finds to recover battery.

## Gun upgrades
Like upgrading drones with modules, you can also upgrade your guns.
