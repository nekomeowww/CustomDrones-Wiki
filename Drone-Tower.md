### Coming inside, you will see a chest at the middle of the "room" surrounded by baby drones.
These baby drones are hostile. They will attack you on sight!

### There usually are 4 floors above the surface, and many many floors below.
The deeper you go, the more guarding drones there are, and the more and rarer loots you will find.
And occasionally you will find a room with a Big baby drone in it, that room is extra difficult thus the loots are extra-plenty!

### The loots include drone bits, drone parts, materials to craft drone stuffs, drone mods, and gun upgrades.
