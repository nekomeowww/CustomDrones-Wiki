This is the screen that opens when you right click your drone with a painter

You can select and apply palettes to quickly change the whole drone's color by choosing the palette in the 1st column (new color will be shown in the model on the right). And then press "Apply palette".  
Or you can edit each part's color by choosing the part in the 2nd column, then choose your color, then press "apply color"
(Color persists over different models). Pressing "reset" will revert that part's color back to default color of the drone.
