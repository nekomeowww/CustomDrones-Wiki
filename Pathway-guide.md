# Getting the necessary materials
### Find the babies
首先呢，找一些超可爱的迷你无人机，比如图中这个；
![Baby drone](http://i.imgur.com/Q9oBI65.png)

你需要把其中一些杀掉（啊啊啊...但是...如果你想要你自己的无人机你就必须这么做）直到你获得一些Drone bits（无人机碎块）
![Drone bits](http://i.imgur.com/KLz6Llx.png)

干得漂亮！15~16个左右的无人机碎块（Drone bits）就足够啦~

### 采掘其他原料
除了无人机碎块，你还需要1个烈焰粉，21个红石，28颗钻石，以及84块铁锭来制作第一个无人机。

# 制作你的第一个无人机
## 制作纤维板
当你准备好上述的所有资源之后，就可以开始一步一步制作无人机了。
第一个物件需要制作的就是： __复合纤维板I型（Composite Fiber Plate MK.I）__ （型号，MK是物件的等级）；
准备54个纤维板即可组装一个完整的无人机

## 制作模块
制作好纤维板之后，就需要制作一个无人机芯片，一个无人机处理器，三个
After the plates, you need to craft 1 drone chip, 1 drone core, 3 drone casings, and 4 drone engines

![Engine](http://i.imgur.com/M2ZQ55N.png)

## And finally, you can craft your drone

## Right click the drone item on the ground to spawn your drone.

# Making a module
Drones can do nothing by themselves (beside looking cool!). They need modules, the things that give drones functions.

## Module place holder
To make a functional module, you first craft a module place holder

## Craft modules
Everything from drone parts to drone modules have 4 tiers (I, II, III, and IV). Better modules are of higher tier.  
With those place holders, craft the modules you want. For starters I recommend always having Items Inventory module and Manual Control movement module installed.  

Craft modules from the list [here](https://github.com/WilliamEz/CustomDrones/wiki/Modules)

# Installing a module
There are 2 ways to install modules.
The easy way: right click the drone with a module in your hand.
The hard way: you need a controller. Read further.

# Controlling your drone
All those previous steps are just preparing for your drone. Now here comes the fun part
## Make the controller
To control your drone you need a Drone Flyer (or just call it a controller)
![Flyer](http://i.imgur.com/R3W10FR.png)

## Connect with the drone
Right click your newly made drone with the controller. And the controller will connect with the drone.
![Connect](http://i.imgur.com/mWH9ZWt.png)

## Open the controller screen
You have connected a controller to a drone. Now right click the controller, and you'll see the controller screen
![Controller screen](http://i.imgur.com/DtW72eo.png)

## Switch it on!
Make sure you have installed Manual Control movement module i said before. Then press "Switch mode" once, and then "Switch drone mode" twice. Now the controller mode is "targeting" and drone mode is "manual control".
![Controller on](http://i.imgur.com/0EiDlsQ.png)

## Fly that s*it!
Exit the screen, look around, and see the drone following your cross-hair!!!
![Fly drone](http://i.imgur.com/qzsEecN.png)

## Stop flying!
To stop controlling drone, either press the switch buttons again, or don't hold the controller in your hand anymore.

### Read [Drone controlling](https://github.com/WilliamEz/CustomDrones/wiki/Drone-controlling) to understand more about the controller and controlling drones

# Healing your drone
You've flown the drone for a while, now it's about to run out of battery. Or maybe you let some crazy guys hit your drone repeatedly, and it is about to run out of health. Now you need to refill battery or recover health for your drone.

## Open the drone screen
To do that you need to open your drone screen. Either right click your drone with an empty hand, or sneak-right click to open drone screen.

## Apply the item
So many parameters there, but for now focus on the item slot at the middle. Put the recovering items there and press "Apply item"
![Apply item](http://i.imgur.com/sMH70Op.png)

### You can also leave the item in the drone's inventory, the drone will consume items automatically when almost out of battery and health.

Read the list of [Recovering items here](https://github.com/WilliamEz/CustomDrones/wiki/Recovering-items).  
You can also install modules by placing them into that item slot and press "Install module" (button name changes depending on item placed in slot). That's the harder way.
