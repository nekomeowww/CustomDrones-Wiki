### To recover battery or health of the drone, you either right click the item on the drone, apply the item in the slot at the middle of the drone screen, or leave the item in the drone inventory, and it'll be consumed automatically when needed.

Items will be consumed immediately until battery/health is full.

# Recover battery
The items to recover battery are:
* Coal: 10 battery
* Iron ingot: 100 battery
* Gold ingot: 200 battery
* Diamond: 1000 battery
* Emerald: 2000 battery


# Recover health
The items to recover health are:
* Iron block: 10 health
* Gold block: 20 health
* Diamond block: 40 health
* Emerald block: 60 health

For example, your drone is having 9020/10000 battery (current/max).  
You recover battery using a stack of iron ingot (100 battery each) with 1 of the 3 ways.  
It'll take 10 iron ingots to bring the battery to maximum (10020 in fact) and then 20 left over battery will be wasted.  
And there's nothing you can do about it.  
Same thing happen to health.
