# Drone parts
## They are Composite fiber plates, Casings, Chips, Cores, and Engines.
### The Composite fiber plates are base for the later 4.
You craft the most basic one (Mk.I) from iron ingot, diamond, and drone bit.

Then you go up the rank one by one.

### Using the CFPlate, you can craft the actual parts of the drone
Whatever rank (I, II, III, IV) you use to craft, the resulting part will be of that rank.

# Drone crafting
### Then you use the parts to make a drone
Note that the different parts don't need to be of the same rank when crafting a drone. You can use a chip MkI, a core MkIV, 3 casings MkIII, and 4 engines MkII, and you will get a drone with different part ranks.

# Parts properties
### Higher rank parts make your drones better in many kinds of ways.
### Casing
Better casing gives your drone more health (2 health = 1 heart), and more inventory slots.
* Casing Mk.I: 10 health, 9 inventory slots
* Casing Mk.II: 20 health, 18 inventory slots
* Casing Mk.III: 40 health, 27 inventory slots
* Casing Mk.IV: 60 health, 36 inventory slots

### Chip
Better chip gives your drone more mod slots, higher max mod rank, further controller range, and also mods installed will also have higher performance
* Chip Mk.I: 3 mod slots, max mod rank I, 64m controller range
* Chip Mk.II: 4 mod slots, max mod rank II, 128m controller range
* Chip Mk.III: 6 mod slots, max mod rank III, 194m controller range
* Chip Mk.IV: 8 mod slots, max mod rank IV, 256m controller range

### Core
Better core gives your drone more battery, and higher base attack
* Core Mk.I: 400 battery, 0.5 heart base attack
* Core Mk.II: 1200 battery, 1 heart base attack
* Core Mk.III: 5200 battery, 1.5 heart base attack
* Core Mk.IV: 13200 battery, 2 heart base attack

### Engine
Better engines means faster drone
* Engine Mk.I: 5m/s max speed (a bit faster than walking, and a bit slower than sprinting)
* Engine Mk.II: 10m/s max speed
* Engine Mk.III: 20m/s max speed
* Engine Mk.IV: 30m/s max speed (a bit faster than sprint-flying)
(an approximate conversion is made that 1m is equal to 1 block)
