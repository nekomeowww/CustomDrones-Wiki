# Drones
Your drone will be your companion, your protector, your flyer, your best friend!
A drone can take many shapes and colors, but this is the default appearance. You spawn the drone by using the drone item on a block.

# Drone screens
To see a drone's properties/information, you need to have the right controller in your inventory (NOTE: not necessarily in your hand, just in your inventory) by connecting a controller to a drone that is not controlled by anyone else.  

### And then right click the drone either with empty hand or when sneaking.

### Or open the Remote screen from that controller screen

The first one allows you to put items into the drone's inventory or get items out from it, also lets you install modules and apply recovery items.  
The second one allows you to modify mods, view the inventory and some basic information from afar.

# Drone information
Let's go though the information one by one
![](http://i.imgur.com/nPKq8Tc.png)  
This piece shows the parts the drone is made up of, the frequency of the drone (only changeable through the Drone flyer), the drone's current flying mode (manual control, or follow player, or off,...), and the Estimated Fly Time (EFT).  
The EFT is a raw calculation of how long the drone will continue to fly (if it is flying), without taking non-continuous mods into consideration. (e.g.: Shooting mod only shoot periodically, each shot consumes battery, but it is not continuous, so that consumption is not taken into estimation)

This piece shows the drone's inner properties
* Mods: 4/4 - means 4 mods installed over the maximum of 4 mods
* Max mod rank: 2 - means the maximum rank of the installing mod is II (gold)
* Max speed: 0m/s - the maximum speed the drone can reach, displays as 0 if not flying, and if you lower the engine level, this will decrease also.
* Health: 17/20 - current health/maximum health (2 health = 1 heart)
* Battery: 0/1200 - current battery/maximum battery

This is where you put mods or recovering items. Then press the button on the left. The result will be displayed below.

This piece shows the installed mods. But you can do nothing with them unless you use the Remote screen.

This button turns your drone back to an item, so you can store it easily.

And this is your drone's inventory and your inventory. If you have Items inventory installed, you can access those inventory slots.
