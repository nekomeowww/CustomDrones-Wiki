# Modules
Drones can do nothing by themselves (beside looking cool!). They need modules.  
Modules are the things that give drones functions when installed to the drone.

Modules are divided into 4 ranks (I, II, III, and IV) implying the functionality/rarity/synthesis of the module.  
They are also divided into 6 categories: Transporting, Collecting, Scouting, Battling, Recovering, and Misc
